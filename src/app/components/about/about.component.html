      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        At <strong>AniBowl</strong>, we are dedicated to feeding needy and helpless animals. Every life matters, and with your support, we can make a significant impact together. Each bowl filled is a step towards kindness, and every donation you make helps us spread love and compassion to those who cannot speak for themselves.

      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>
        Our primary focus is on feeding animals with empty bowls who are silently calling for help. After the donation period ends, we will go out into the community to fill as many bowls as we can. All donations will be dedicated solely to purchasing food for street animals.

        <h2>Meet the Founder</h2>

        <p>
          I am Sanjay Verma. Whenever I walk the streets, I often see empty bowls and hungry eyes of animals waiting for help. It pains me to realize that while I can fill a bowl for one, countless others remain unfed. The moment I drop food into a bowl and see a grateful animal, my heart fills with joy. This deep-seated need to make a difference sparked the creation of AniBowl. As a web developer, I wanted to craft a project that could not only showcase my skills but also positively impact the lives of these voiceless beings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through AniBowl, I hope to invite others to share this experience, to feel the joy of giving, even if they are short on time. Together, we can fill bowls with food and happiness, giving these animals a chance to thrive.

      <h2>Important Note</h2>
      <p>
        We want to clarify that <strong>AniBowl</strong> is a personal project created by me, Sanjay Verma, for practice in web development. This website is not affiliated with any organization or community; it is simply an initiative to help needy street animals while I learn and grow in my skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        The donations collected through this platform are solely for purchasing food to feed these animals. If you are unable to feed them directly due to time constraints, your contributions will allow me to do so on your behalf.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please understand that this is not a formal organization; it is an effort driven by a passion for animal welfare and a desire to learn. Your generosity will go directly to the welfare of street animals in our community, but I cannot guarantee any legal entity status or official recognition.
